# 2024 Property Tax Protest - Travis

<!-- I'm planning to DIY my property tax protest this year on my primary residence. This will be my second attempt at protesting.

In my last attempt, 3 years ago, was on the Manor house. I compiled a few nearby comprable properties; viewed their values on TCAD, drive by and noted things that I thought would have brought up their property values in comparison to mine. It resulted in a rejection for lowering my property taxes and an invite to a meeting. I ended up not attending and that was the end of it.

This year I'm coming with information I learned from a webinar and am hopeful to try a different tactic, attend the meeting if needed and come out with a positive outcome. -->

## Introduction

This page will be used as a reference for filing my property tax protest. The details I've gathered here are all based on the webinar hosted in 2023 by Land Sale TX.

## File My Protest

The deadline to file your protest will be located at the top of your notice (usually around May 15). I'll be using the online method to file my protest. Other options available include mail and in-person.

>[!ATTENTION] Filing Deadline
> Do ^^**NOT**^^ miss the filing deadline. There are very limited extenuating circumstances where the county will make an exception if the deadline is missed.

### Items to Request When Filing Protest

Feel free to request anything you think can be used to help your case. Below are a few important items specifically called out during the webinar.

- Detailed property appraisal card
- Comparable properties and their appraisal cards
- Equity approach compared to a neighbor whose home is similar to yours; requested appraisal card
- Class categorization documentation that details how county classifies categories.

Use the comments section or freely type up the items request and attach it to your protest.

> Example:
> "I request to receive all information used to determine my property card, comps and detailed appraisal cards."
> [!INFO] Open Records Response Time
> The response time for an Open Records Request is ^^2 Weeks^^.
>
>This is only a response, ^^**NOT**^^ the timeline of when you will receive the information requested. Be sure to frequently check mail during this time frame.

### Helpful Info

Photos - Include images for anything mentioned for protesting your property values.

Comps - You can obtain comparables of other properties in your neighborhood from the following options.

- Have a real estate agent do an MLS lookup of confirmed properties sold in the prior year. (Holds the most weight)
- By request from county of properties used for appraisal.
- County clerk CAD website records; Check if there is a mortgage on a property and do the math. (i.e. Standard mortgage is 20% down + mortgage. Other loan types FHA = 5% down)

Deadline To Protest - _Typically around May 15_

- Can be change based on if notices go out later.
- Check the date on the top of your notice for exact date.
- Check notice to ensure homestead exemption is listed - if homestead exemption is missed; can retroactively get the exemption.

Property Tax cap - There is ^^NO^^ cap on appraisal values except on homestead exemptions.

Homestead Exemptions - Properties are protected from increasing property taxes more than 10% in any given year. However, increased values will be adjusted to spread out across multiple years.

Taxable Value - The current taxable value for homestead exempted properties was increased in 2023 from 25k to 40k.

## Post-Filing Procedures

After filing your protest you can expect the following process below to lower your property taxes for the year.

- [Informal Offer by mail](#by-mail)
- [Informal Hearing](#by-hearing)
- [Formal Board Review](#formal-board-meeting)
- Arbitration - _Not used often, cost involved, will not go into details on this page._

>[!Success] Fair Offer - Received
> At any point during the process; if you feel you have received a fair offer then accept it to complete the process.
>
> Values should be viewed at market value. Ask yourself if you would sale your home for this much or more to determine if the assessment is a good, fair value.

### Informal Process

For the informal process you can expect either one, or possibly both of the informal responses below.

#### By Mail

The county may provide you a lower offer by mail where you can decide if you would like to accept or reject the offer.

#### By Hearing

The "By Mail" offer may be skipped immediately or if the homeowner rejects all "By Mail" offers then the county will send a mail notice with a hearing date set.

The hearing can be done online, over the phone, or in-person (preferred).

In this step of the process you will be presented with the evidence the county has to justify your property value. This can be helpful if you continue onto the formal route, in that, you will be able to use the evidence presented by the county to go home and counteract the information they presented for the Formal Board Meeting.

### Formal Board Meeting

A formal board meeting date can be set as a result of any of the following.

- Property owner rejected all previous informal offers.
- New sale protest.

If an informal offer has been made and you go to the board; and it is not noted in your file be prepared in case they set it back up at market value. Take the offer if you feel the offer is fair.

Final step after formal board haring is to go through arbitration.

## FAQs

> [!Question]- Should all info be ready to protest by informal hearing date or 5/15?
> **Answer**: Informal hearing date.

>[!Question]- How do districts appraise property?
> **Answer**: Use prior year's sales to generate this years value.
    > [!Tip] Find comparables: Ask JR to pull comparable sales from MLS from the prior year.
>[!Question]- Are there times when you dont want to protest your property tax?
> **Answer**: If you bought your home at a high point in the market and there is a difference between the valuation and what you paid.
    >[!Example] Example: Do Not Protest
    > Home purchased @ 100k; assessment value @ 50k = Dont protest.

    >[!Example] Example: Protest
    > Home purchased @ 500k; assessment value @ 600k = PROTEST (In this example you can show proof of your closing statement to show what you paid vs. what they're marking it up to.
    > This ^^MUST^^ be in the year of the assesed value.Since values are appraised from prior year's home sales.
    >
    > (E.g. Using this method 2 years after your home purchase and taking in your hud disclosure statement would not work)
>[!Note] New Home Sales
> If it's a new sale and you're talking to someone informally; high chance of no adjustement. Reasoning: Its part of datapoints to establish a baseline used for ratio study. Typically assessor needs to be between 95-105% of value. If adjusted on a new sale; the assessor may fail their state study which could result in loss of funding for schools, etc.
>
> For new sales its typical that you would be skipped for informal process and go striaght to appraisal review board.

>[!Question]- No comparison properties; How do you compare?
> Ex. Smallest home in neighborhood.
> **Answer**: Use an equity approach. Example of equity approach; your home is rectangular vs other homes that are classed the same as yours; they have other designs/shapes and different rooflines. (SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED DIFFERENTLY)

>[!Question]- Improvements to properties
> Answer: Home values are assessed as they are as of January 1st.
> Ex. If you bought property on Nov but didnt start construction until Jan. 10; you should be assessed as just a lot since that was the state of the property as of jan 1.
>
>Ex2. On jan 1 if house was only 50% done you should be assessed at that percentage and not 100%.
>
    >[!Info] Interior v. Exterior
    > You do not have to disclose interior improvments. Exterior improvements can be seen. County has right to go to your property to assess value.
